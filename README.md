This application will send you a message with the percentage difference between a chosen stock's closing prices from the last two days. Additionally, it will display the three most recent and popular news articles. It was created using Pyton v3.13.

This app calls 2 APIs:
- Stock Market Data API (https://www.alphavantage.co/)
- News API (https://newsapi.org/)
Both APIs have a free plan, but they require a API Key to be registered and the keys to be populated in the sorce code of the app (STOCK_API_KEY and NEWS_API_KEY variables).

Run main.py to start the app. By default, it provide information about Nvidia's stock market prices and news (change COMPANY_NAME and STOCK_SYMBOL to your preferred company).
This app can be improven
